Hi, my name is Dr. Nyabisi Mengo I work at the intersection of education, technology, and real-world impact, and I’ve been doing that for over fifteen years.
I hold a Ph.D. in Hospitality and Tourism Management and I’m also a trained full-stack developer. Over the years, I’ve held senior academic and administrative roles, including serving as a dean and as a Visiting Scholar at the University of South Florida. My work has focused on designing learner-centered programs, leading institutional change, and aligning strategy, people, and technology to deliver impact.
On the technical side, I build both front-end and back-end applications. I work with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, React Native, and Expo, with backend experience using Maven and Spring Boot. This allows me to move beyond theory and actually build scalable digital solutions—especially in EdTech, learning platforms, and technology-enabled services.
I’ve also led and facilitated international workshops and webinars, and I’m actively involved in global tech and education communities. I have served as President of the IFITT Africa Chapter and help run AI Salon events in the St. Pete–Tampa area.
Alongside this, I founded and lead a nonprofit focused on community-based education and youth empowerment, which keeps my work grounded in real-world impact.
Having worked across Africa and the United States, I’m comfortable operating in multicultural, distributed teams and global environments. This international exposure has strengthened my ability to adapt products and learning systems to varied user needs, and communicate across cultural and organizational boundaries. I’m especially interested in product, EdTech, and digital transformation roles where strategy, technology, cultural intelligence, and human-centered design come together.
